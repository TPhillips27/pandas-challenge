Observable trends

1: Male dominated.  This has been a fairly historical trend for males to be more invovled with gaming than women.  A lot of teenagers use it, it grows during college, and remains a present activity for many men during their 20s. 

2.Tota purchase value.  The majority game purchasers being 20-24 would be logical. It will cover those that are just out or almost out of college. People graduate, start earning some money, and can spend more money on games than with a limited budget while in school, or asking for parents like those that fall into the teenage group. A vast majority of people nowadays tend to stay at home for a couple years after college due to high costs of living in a lot of areas and having a salary that doesn't allow them to move out. They can save a lot of money but also indulge on hobbies such as playing videos due to the lower amount of responsibilities. 

3. Men buying more items.  This is quite easy to assume as the majority of gamers are men.  With men being nearly 85% of the gamers then it is logical that they would end up purchasing more items and spending more overall.
